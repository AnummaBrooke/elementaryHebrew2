### Attendance: 

Our course meets on an unusual schedule: TWR, one hour each day. I will have carefully adjusted our activities and assignments to make the most of this schedule. *Make attendance a priority.** It is a central tenet of our course that *we are not in it only for ourselves, but for our classmates as well.* Our colleagues depend utterly on our regular, informed, prepared presence in class.

Every absence, for any reason, will count against a student's participation grade. At the instructor's sole discretion, extreme or frequent tardiness will also incur "absences." Missing three sessions may result in loss of a full letter grade in the course. Students who miss as much as 20% of sessions should not expect to pass the course.
