### Courtesy:

We agree to be fully present to our classmates during our sessions. Phones and laptops will only be used in ways directly related to activities underway during our class time. Students may not accept phone calls or TMs during class, nor engage in side conversations and side texting except where we agree to such back channels. Web-surfing not related to the activity underway is profoundly discourteous and will not be permitted. During quizzes and exams, all electronic devices must be turned off.

Again: it is *not okay* to "take a break" during class and engage in unrelated web activity.

If the instructor is convinced that extra-curricular web activity has become a distraction, a no-laptop policy will be introduced, and everyone will know that it is your fault.
