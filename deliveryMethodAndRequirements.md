##Delivery Method and Requirements:

We begin with oral exercises, becoming familiar with the sounds and basic structures of the Hebrew language. We will work through the grammar throughout the middle of the year, roughly the latter 2/3 of the Fall term and the initial half of the Spring term. In the last weeks of the Spring term, we will take our Reading Examination and complete work on our exegesis papers. *I agree* to provide a variety of exercises and resources and to stay abreast of your progress. *You agree* to work *at least 6â€“8 hours each week outside of class in focused, undistracted work* on the course (I recommend **daily blocks**). *We both agree* that our goal is to complete the course of introductory grammar, because experience shows that students not exposed to all the grammar find themselves at a severe disadvantage to use any of it in exegesis. **Experience and studies show that successful translators are those that read fluently, and that reading fluency depends on communicating daily in the target language.** If your goals for the course are more limited (exposure to or appreciation of the language; an ability to handle the aleph-bet and navigate dictionaries), then you should strongly consider not taking this course.
